Move from old fossil-fuel vehicles to electric vehicles, using the power of data and software. *EV-Fleet-Sim* can help corporates and governments to project the energy and charging requirements that would need to be met if their fossil-fuel vehicles where migrated to electric-vehicles.

Get started by installing and running the program, as explained in the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs)

For scientists and programmers: the software is open source and can be modified. Download the source code from [here](https://gitlab.com/eputs/ev-fleet-sim).
