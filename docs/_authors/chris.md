Chris first fell in love with Africa back when he rode his bicycle on the clay streets of rural Eastern Cape at age three. It saddens him to see Africa's inheritance of forests, minerals and wildlife pillaged and destroyed for short-term gain. Armed with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering (Cum-Laude), Chris hopes to combat this problem through his research in renewable energy and green transport. With 30,000 views on his first YouTube lecture, he hopes to further educate and enable millions more to tackle these problems and to build the continent, rather than consume it.
