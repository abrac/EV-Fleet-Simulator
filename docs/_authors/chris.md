I am a masterâ€™s degree student, aspiring to become a professional researcher and lecturer. I am interested in the topics of electric mobility and renewable energy. My vision is to have more equitable transport and energy access in developing countries, especially in rural areas which suffer the most. My current research project is to investigate the impact of adopting electric vehicles into informal public-transport systems of developing countries.
