title: Usage
---

Here are the steps to create your first simulation scenario:

EV-Fleet-Sim requires you to create a folder for the scenario that you would like to simulate. This folder will contain the input data, and the simulation results.

1. Create a folder for the scenario that you want to create. Let's call this folder `<simulation-dir>`.

2. Open a terminal and run `ev-fleet-sim`. The program will ask you for the scenario directory. Enter in `<simulation-dir>`. Tip, you can also run `ev-fleet-sim <simulation-dir>` to skip the prompt.

3. Follow the prompts. The program will ask you which "step" you want to execute. Since
   this is a new scenario, you want to run step 0, which initialises the
   scenario's directory structure. Enter `0` to initialise the scenario.

4. After you have don that, you will need to follow the steps in the [below initialisation instructions](#initialisation-instructions). The instructions are quite detailed, so please take your time at this step and [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/contact.html) if you face any difficulties!

5. Proceed to run the remaining steps of the program, by running again:

    ```sh
    ev-fleet-sim <simulation-dir>
    ```

    Run the script iteratively, each time selecting the next steps in the list 
    of steps.

Notes: 

* The list of steps will be presented to you when your run `ev-fleet-sim`.

* After step 0, you will find a `readme.json` file in `<simulation-dir>`. This file contains a list with the directory structure of the scenario. The order of sub-directories shown in this list is the order in which the program generates its outputs. I.e. Step *1* will generate its outputs in the *1st* directory specified in the list.

* Additional usage instructions can be found by entering 

  ```sh 
  ev-fleet-sim --help
  ```

  in a terminal.


Initialisation Instructions
===========================

> Definitions: 
> 
> `<simulation-dir>/` refers to the root directory of the scenario.

Firstly, run the scenario-initialisation step of EV-Fleet-Sim to create the
folder structure in your scenario directory (`<simulation-dir>`).

Initialising Trace Data
-----------------------

1. Copy your fleet's raw vehicle data to 
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/Original`.

   EV-Fleet-Sim supports two data formats: [floating car data (FCD)](
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_car_data) (also commonly referred to 
   as "GPS traces"), and [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](
   https://gtfs.org/). (GTFS is a way of digitally representing 
   public-transport schedules.)

   If the raw data is FCD, proceed to the next step.

   If the raw data is GTFS data, it should be a zipped archive. Rename the
   archive to "GTFS_Orig.zip". Unzip the GTFS archive into: 
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/Original/GTFS`.

   Make sure that GTFS data complies to the following caveats:

   1. Arrival times *and* departure times must be defined in `stop_times.csv`.
      They should not be equal to the same value.

   1. `frequencies.txt` must be defined for each and every trip.

1. As mentioned previously, your input data may be FCD or GTFS data. We need to
   convert the input data fromat to *CSV files* that can be read by
   EV-Fleet-Sim. Please see the [table
   below](#table%3A-csv-input-format-for-ev-fleet-sim) which outlines the
   columns that are required in each CSV file, and the format that their values
   need to conform to.

   ##### FCD Conversion

   If your input data is floating car data, you will need to create a
   script to transform the gps-traces to CSV files. You must generate one CSV 
   file per vehicle in the fleet.

   Some template scripts are available on our [Git repository](https://gitlab.com/eputs/ev-fleet-sim/-/tree/master/src/data_processing_ev/scenario_initialisation/Data_Pre-Processing) to help you create your script.

   ##### GTFS Conversion

   If your input data is of the GTFS data format, you should use the `GTFS_Convert.r` and `GTFS_Splitter.py` scripts which are also in our [Git repository](https://gitlab.com/eputs/ev-fleet-sim/-/tree/master/src/data_processing_ev/scenario_initialisation/Data_Pre-Processing). You can use them as-is. No changes should be necessary. The scripts will generate one csv file per [trip](https://gtfs.org/reference/static#dataset-files) defined in the GTFS data.

   First run `GTFS_Convert.r`. After running it, extract the new file:
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/Original/GTFS.zip` to 
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/Original/GTFS/`.

   After this, run the `GTFS_Splitter.py` script. It will tell you the maximum
   and minimum GPS coorindates encountered. Hold onto these values. They will
   be useful when [generating the road-network](#initialising-road-network).

   Notes:
   ======

   The headings marked with `*` are required. 

   Headings marked with `+` are conditionally required.

   Unmarked headings are not required, and are not currently used by
   EV-Fleet-Sim. They may be used in the future.

   If you are not using a coloumn, leave its fields blank. (i.e. Don't fill it
   with zeroes.)

   [^1]: Horizontal Dilution of Precision. Lower is better.
   [^2]: StopID column only required for GTFS input data.
   [^3]: E.g: 2022-04-17 09:03:49
   ```

1. Copy the script(s) to the `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/` directory and run 
   them.

1. Make sure the processed traces are in 
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Traces/Processed`.

Vehicle Definition
------------------

1. Open the `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Configs/ev_template.xml` file in your
   favourite text editor.

1. Choose a [vehicle class](
   https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.html#abstract_vehicle_class
   ) that will represent your fleet in SUMO. Try to choose the class that most
   closely represents the type of vehicle you are trying to simulate. If you 
   don't know which one to choose, choose the "passenger" vehicle type.

   (List of available vehicle classes: [SUMO Documentation](
    https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.html#abstract_vehicle_class))  
   (Default parameters of the various vehicle classes: [SUMO Documentation](
    https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Vehicle_Type_Parameter_Defaults.html))

1. In this file, find the `vType` *element*: 
   ```xml
   <vType ... >

       â‹®

   </vType>
   ```

   In the `vType` element, find the `vClass` *attribute*:
   ```xml
   <vType ... vClass="value" ... >
   ```

   Change this attribute's value to the desired vehicle class. Change the other
   attributes of the `vType` element if desired. (To read more about the
   attributes and what their values mean, refer: [SUMO
   documentation](
   https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.html#available_vtype_attributes).)

   Find the `param` elements:
   ```xml
   <param  key="..."  value="..." >
   ```

   If desired, you can change the values of the various parameters to modify
   the electric-vehicle model.

   (Reference to electric vehicle parameters: [SUMO Documentation](
    https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Models/Electric.html#defining_electric_vehicles))

Initialising Road Network
-------------------------

1. Go to `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Map/Boundary`. You will find a file called
   `boundary.csv`. It is a csv file with two columns. Each row represents the
   coordinates of each of the four points in the boundary box that you would
   like to create.

   |   Longitude |    Latitude |
   |------------:|------------:|
   | `<min_lon>` | `<min_lat>` |
   | `<max_lon>` | `<min_lat>` |
   | `<max_lon>` | `<max_lat>` |
   | `<min_lon>` | `<max_lat>` |

   This bounding box will be used during the simulation. For FCD, if a vehicle
   leaves this bounding box on a particular day, that day's data will be
   discarded. For GTFS data, it is recommended to create a bounding box
   corresponding to the values given by `GTFS_Splitter.py` as [explained
   previously](#gtfs-conversion).

1. Download an `osm.pbf` file which represents the country. Currently, they are
   available from [geofabrik.de](https://download.geofabrik.de/). [Other
   sources](
   https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#Country_and_area_extracts)
   are available and more information about pbf files can be found at the [OSM
   wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format).

1. Copy the `.osm.pbf` file to `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Map/Construction`. 

   You will find a bash script called `pbf_to_osm.sh` (`pbf_to_osm.bat` in Windows) in the `Construction` directory. Open it in a text editor. In MacOS and Linux, find the line which has `--bbox <min_lon>,<min_lat>,<max_lon>,<max_lat>`. On Windows, find the line which has `-b=<min_lon>,<min_lat>,<max_lon>,<max_lat>`. Modify the line to correspond with the values added to `boundary.csv`. 

   > E.g: `--bbox 18.6,-34.3,19.0,-33.7`<br>
   > Or in Windows: `-b=18.6,-34.3,19.0,-33.7`

   Run the modified `.sh`/`.bat` file to convert the `.osm.pbf` file to a `.osm` file, while cropping to the specified boundary.

1. <a id="importing-elevation-data"></a> ***Optional step: Importing elevation data*** 

    By default, OSM does not include elevation data. If you would like to use elevation data to create a more realistic simulation, then you will need to follow the following instructions:


    <details markdown='1' style="background:#EEEEEE;padding: 0.5em;"><summary>Click to view</summary><br>

    By default, OSM does not include elevation data. Elevation is supported by EV-Fleet-Sim to create more realistic simulations. In order to use that functionality, elevation data needs to be overlayed on the input OSM file. To do this, you need to install `osmosis`, and the `osmosis-srtm` plug-in.

    To install them, follow the steps below:

    1.  Download and unpack [Osmosis 0.45](https://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-0.45.zip) in a folder in your computer. We will call that folder `<osmosis-folder>`.

    2.  Clone and build the [osmosis-srtm
        plug-in](https://github.com/locked-fg/osmosis-srtm-plugin.git) repo. 

        **OR:**

        Download the pre-built [jar file](https://github.com/locked-fg/osmosis-srtm-plugin/files/8027597/srtmplugin-1.1.2.jar.zip) and place it in `<osmosis-folder>\lib\default`.

    3.  Create an `osmosis-plugins.conf` file in the config-folder and add
        this line: 

        `de.locked.osmosis.srtmplugin.SrtmPlugin_loader`

    Downloading elevation data:

    1.  Create and sign into an account on [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

    2.  Play around on the map until the entire area you want to cover is
        seen.

    3.  Click on the "Use map" button and continue to data set

    4.  Check the *Use Data Set Prefilter* box and type: "NASA SRTM3
        SRTMGL3" in the *Data Set Search* bar. Make sure only the checkbox
        named "NASA SRTM3 SRTMGL3" is ticked

    5.  Click the "Results" button.

    6.  For each of the results, click "Download Options" and download the
        HGT file.

    7.  Unzip all of the downloads and place them together in a folder.

    Overlaying elevation data on OSM:

    1.  After cropping and converting the downloaded OSM file (after
        completing the previous step of the Initialising Road Network instructions),
        place it in `<osmosis-folder>`. Let's call it `test.osm`.

    2.  Run the following line in you command prompt:

        ```sh
        osmosis --read-xml <osmosis-folder>/test.osm --write-srtm locDir=<location-of-unzipped-SRTM-files> repExisting=true tagName=ele --write-xml <osmosis-folder>/test_with_srtm.osm
        ```

    3.  The `test_with_srtm.osm` file will be found in `<osmosis-folder>`.

    4.  Rename the file to `square_boundary.osm` and place it in `<scenario-dir>\_Inputs\Map\Construction`.

    5.  Continue to the next step in the Initialising Road Network instructions.
    </details><br>

1. You will also find a `net_convert.sh` file in the `Construction` directory. We will run this script to convert the `.osm` file to a `.net.xml` file (the road-network file-format that is compatible with SUMO). 

   But before we do that, you may want to take note of the `.typ.xml` file that is present in the `Construction` directory. This is a *SUMO edge-type file*.

   The `.typ.xml` file defines which vehicle classes are allowed to access the various road types. It can optionally be modified to suit the context of the scenario.

   For example, gravel roads (`highway.track`) are common in developing countries, and hence it would be expected that vehicles have access to those roads in the simulation (since tar roads are less common). In cities of developed countries, where gravel roads are less common, it may be appropriate to restrict vehicles from accessing them.

1. <a id="setting-road-access-permissions"></a>***Optional step: Setting Road Access Permissions***

   Remember that [previously](#vehicle-definition) we chose a vehicle class to represent our fleet? Now we need to choose which road-types allow our vehicle class.

   Open the `.typ.xml` file in your favourite text editor. For each road-type listed, change the `disallow` and `allow` attributes to allow/disallow your vehicle class. You can also change the other attributes, such as the speed limits on the various road types.

   (Description of the various road types: [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features#Highway))

   (More information on SUMO edge-type files: [SUMO Documentation](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/SUMO_edge_type_file.html))

1. Now we can proceed to run the `net_convert.sh` script. 

    The script will prompt you to ask you if the scenario has left- or right-handed traffic. It will also ask you if you want to import elevation data from the OSM file. This option will only work if you [import elevation data](#importing-elevation-data) as explained previously.

   As the script runs, sometimes it
   will throw many warnings due to badly formed data. If you have time, try and
   fix the warnings by editing the `.net.xml` file in NETEDIT. (I usually
   ignore the errors, because most can be safely ignored.)

   There is one warning that requires special mention: If you get the following
   warning: `Warning: Discarding unusable type ...`, it means that netconvert
   encountered a road type which is not defined in the `typ.xml` file.
   In such cases, netconvert will ignore roads which have not been defined.
   (I.e. It will pretend as if they didn't exist.) If the road type is
   important to you, add it to the `.typ.xml` file, and [set it's access
   permissions](#setting-road-access-permissions).

   Once the scrpt is done running, the `.net.xml` file can be found in: 
   `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Map/`, and a log of the warnings will be saved as a
   text file in the `Construction` directory.

   (Description of netconvert warnings and the recommended actions: [SUMO
   Documentation](
   https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Networks/Import/OpenStreetMap.html#warnings_during_import))

1. We have now initialised the road network. However, if you want to make small
   changes, or view the generated road network graphically, you can open the 
   `.net.xml` file with the `Netedit` software which comes with SUMO. 

   (Netedit usage instructions: [SUMO Documentation](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Netedit/index.html))

Initialising Weather Data
-------------------------

Because EV-Fleet-Sim also does renewable energy calculations, you may also put
weather data files in the `<simulation-dir>/_Inputs/Weather` directory. If you are
not interested in doing renewable energy calculations, you may leave the
directory empty.

This data can be obtained by first installing [SAM](https://sam.nrel.gov/), and
using its user interface to download the data for the location that you need.
In the case of solar energy data, SAM should have data for almost any location
around the world. In the case of wind data, they only provide data for
locations in the USA. In case they don't have data for the location that you
are interested in, or if you just want to use your own dataset, you will need
to re-format the data into a format that can be read by SAM. The following
document described the format that is readable by SAM: 

- For version 2020.2.29 r1 (current version as of writing) see: 
  [this PDF](https://sam.nrel.gov/images/web_page_files/sam-help-2020-2-29-r2_weather_file_formats.pdf)
