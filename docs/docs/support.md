title: Getting Support
...

If needing support, kindly contact the lead programmer via <a href="mailto:{{site.email | encode_email}}">email</a> or [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/eputs/ev-fleet-sim/-/issues) on GitLab. When seeking support for a specific scenario, please compress the `_Inputs` and `_Logs` folders of the scenario into a single archive and attach it to the email.

Kindly allow around 1--2 weeks for a response, when requiring support via email. Paid consultation packages are available for more urgent and in-depth support requests. Contact the lead programmer for more information.
